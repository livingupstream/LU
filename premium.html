  <h1>Living Upstream</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    A practical framework for awareness, alignment, and conscious living
  </p>

  <section class="intro">
    <p>
      <strong>Living Upstream</strong> is not a belief system, a motivational program,
      or a promise of transformation through effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a grounded framework for understanding how perception, attention,
      and internal orientation shape lived experience — and how much of human
      suffering comes from reacting downstream instead of orienting upstream.
    </p>
    <p>
      These books are written for people who are tired of noise, spiritual performance,
      productivity pressure, and recycled advice — and who are ready for clarity,
      responsibility, and internal coherence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="why">
    <h3>Why this was written</h3>
    <p>
      Living Upstream was written out of lived observation — not theory.
      Years of noticing patterns in stress, collapse, recovery, growth,
      and alignment across real life situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The material avoids hype, emotional manipulation, and abstract spirituality.
      Instead, it focuses on orientation, awareness, and practical integration
      that can be applied regardless of background, belief, or circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aim is not to fix you — but to help you see clearly enough
      to stop fighting the current you are standing in.
    </p>

      <h2>Book 1 — Foundations</h2>
      <p>
        Book 1 establishes the core orientation of Living Upstream.
        It explores awareness, attention, internal posture,
        and how unconscious reactions shape experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        This book is about seeing — not changing.
        Understanding where effort is wasted and where clarity removes struggle.

        and clarity is tested against reality.
