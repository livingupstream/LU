  <h1>Living Upstream</h1>
  <p class="tagline">Direction over intensity. Continuity over motivation.</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Living Upstream</strong> is a reflective, practical book by
    <strong>Vernon Heckler</strong> about maintaining direction when motivation,
    energy, money, or certainty are limited.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was written for people rebuilding, recalibrating, or quietly stabilizing
    their lives — not optimizing or hustling.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than offering hype, productivity hacks, or forced positivity,
    <em>Living Upstream</em> presents a grounded framework built on awareness,
    attention, energy protection, and small repeatable actions that survive
    real pressure.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Message</h2>
  <p><strong>Direction matters more than intensity.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Continuity matters more than motivation.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Orientation matters more than speed.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Living Upstream helps readers:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stay aligned during low-energy or uncertain periods</li>
    <li>Reduce self-punishment and burnout cycles</li>
    <li>Protect attention and energy from constant downstream pressure</li>
    <li>Build small, sustainable practices that compound quietly over time</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Author</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Vernon Heckler</strong> is an independent writer focused on attention,
    alignment, and sustainable living under pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
    His work centers on clarity without force, discipline without self-punishment,
    and direction without hype.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Living Upstream</em> was written from lived constraint rather than
    theoretical optimization — shaped by uncertainty, limited resources,
    and the need for practices that hold up when motivation disappears.
