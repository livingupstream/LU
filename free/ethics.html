  <h1>Ethics & Responsibility</h1>

  <blockquote>
    Living Upstream is not about authority, belief, or control.<br>
    It is about awareness, responsibility, and conscious choice.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Purpose of This Work</h2>
  <p>
    Living Upstream exists to explore awareness, alignment, and personal responsibility.
    The material presented here is intended as reflective, educational, and experiential guidance —
    not instruction, doctrine, or belief systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is to help individuals think more clearly, act more consciously,
    and take ownership of their inner and outer lives.
  </p>

  <h2>No Authority, No Gurus</h2>
  <p>
    Living Upstream does not claim authority over your life, decisions, or worldview.
    There are no gurus, leaders, or figures to follow.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are encouraged to question everything, including the material presented here.
    If something does not resonate or serve your well-being, you are free to discard it.
  </p>

  <h2>Personal Responsibility</h2>
  <p>
    All practices, reflections, and exercises are optional and self-directed.
    You are fully responsible for how you apply — or choose not to apply — this material.
  </p>

  <p>
    Living Upstream does not replace professional medical, psychological, legal,
    or financial advice. If you are experiencing distress, illness, or crisis,
    seek qualified professional support.
  </p>

  <h2>Mental and Emotional Well-Being</h2>
  <p>
    Some content may invite deep self-reflection. This can be valuable,
    but it can also surface strong emotions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Engage at your own pace. Pause or stop if something feels overwhelming.
    Awareness grows through patience, not force.
  </p>

  <h2>Non-Manipulation & Non-Coercion</h2>
  <p>
    Living Upstream explicitly rejects manipulation, fear-based influence,
    dependency creation, or coercive persuasion.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>No pressure to buy, subscribe, or continue.</li>
    <li>No promises of guaranteed outcomes.</li>
    <li>No claims of exclusive or hidden truth.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Financial Transparency</h2>
  <p>
    Paid material exists to support the sustainability of the project.
    Pricing is straightforward and optional.
  </p>

  <p>
    Free material is offered without obligation, and paid material does not grant
    superiority, status, or authority.
  </p>

  <h2>Respect for Autonomy</h2>
  <p>
    Living Upstream respects individual autonomy, diversity of belief,
    and personal boundaries.
  </p>

  <p>
    This work is not affiliated with any religion, ideology, political movement,
    or organization.
  </p>

  <h2>Closing Note</h2>
  <blockquote>
    True alignment does not come from being told what to think.<br>
    It emerges when awareness, responsibility, and honesty meet.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    If you engage with Living Upstream, do so freely, consciously,
    and on your own terms.
