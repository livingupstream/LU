  <h1>Living Upstream — Book 1: Foundations</h1>

  <h2>Chapter 5 — The Power of Micro-Decisions</h2>

  <p>Upstream living is less about grand, sweeping actions and more about <strong>the micro-decisions we make constantly</strong>. Each choice, no matter how small, nudges the currents of life toward clarity or chaos. Micro-decisions accumulate, shaping habits, energy, and focus — and ultimately, the trajectory of our lives.</p>

  <p>Consider waking up in the morning. The decision to scroll your phone immediately, to drink water, or to step outside influences not only the next hour but sets a tone for the entire day. Each micro-decision is a current; some carry you downstream, others upstream.</p>

  <div class="exercise">
    <h3>Exercise: Daily Micro-Decision Awareness</h3>
    <p>For one full day, write down every decision you consciously notice — what to eat, how to respond to a message, which task to prioritize. Label each as upstream, neutral, or downstream. Reflect on how each small decision affects your mood, energy, and productivity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="story">
    <h3>Story: The Pebble and the Stream</h3>
    <p>A pebble dropped into a stream creates ripples far beyond its size. Micro-decisions are pebbles in your life’s stream. One choice to pause before responding to an email, one choice to take a short walk, one choice to hydrate — these ripples accumulate. Over time, small upstream choices create a current strong enough to carry you against the downstream pull.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Upstream micro-decisions also require intentional <strong>habits and routines</strong>. By designing your day with small, deliberate actions — a 5-minute meditation, a brief journaling session, mindful walking — you reinforce energy, focus, and awareness. These micro-decisions are not just tasks; they are <strong>anchors in your flow</strong>.</p>

  <div class="reflection">
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Notice where micro-decisions are made unconsciously. Which automatic choices drain energy or attention? Which small choices amplify clarity, focus, and resilience? Becoming aware of these micro-currents allows you to intervene intentionally and redirect them upstream.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="exercise">
    <h3>Extended Exercise: Micro-Decision Ladder</h3>
    <p>Make a list of five micro-decisions that can positively impact your day tomorrow. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Drink a glass of water first thing in the morning</li>
      <li>Step outside for 3 minutes of fresh air before work</li>
      <li>Pause before replying to messages</li>
      <li>Take a short stretch break every hour</li>
      <li>Write down one thing you are grateful for before bed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Commit to them and observe how these small upstream choices influence your energy, focus, and sense of control throughout the day.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="reflection">
    <h3>Practical Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stack micro-decisions: link a small positive action to an existing habit</li>
      <li>Use reminders or cues to reinforce upstream decisions</li>
      <li>Reflect weekly: which micro-decisions consistently yield positive outcomes?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="reflection">
    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Which micro-decisions currently pull you downstream?</li>
      <li>Which upstream micro-decisions could compound into meaningful results?</li>
      <li>How can you build a sequence of micro-decisions that support your highest priorities?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="microaction">
    <h3>Micro-Action Plan</h3>
    <p>Tomorrow, select three upstream micro-decisions and consciously execute them. Track the effect on your energy, mood, and focus. Over one week, expand to five or more, forming a <strong>daily ladder of upstream choices</strong> that naturally strengthens your living upstream practice.</p>
