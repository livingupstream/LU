  <h1>Living Upstream — Book 1: Foundations</h1>

  <h2>Chapter 3 — Anchoring Energy</h2>

  <p>Awareness and focus are powerful, but without anchored energy, upstream living becomes fragile. Energy is the river beneath the surface currents of attention and action. Anchoring it means maintaining sustainable flow, avoiding drains, and consciously cultivating sources of vitality.</p>

  <p>Many people live scattered, letting energy leak in countless directions: endless notifications, poor sleep, reactive emotional responses, multitasking. Upstream living requires channeling energy with intention — protecting it, replenishing it, and using it for meaningful action.</p>

  <div class="exercise">
    <h3>Exercise: Energy Audit</h3>
    <p>Spend a day tracking your energy levels in a journal. Note high and low points, and the activities, people, or environments associated with each. Identify energy drains and energy boosters. Over the next week, adjust your schedule to minimize drains and amplify sources of vitality.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="story">
    <h3>Story: The Keeper of Fire</h3>
    <p>Imagine a keeper tending a fire. He cannot rush the flames; he must feed it carefully, remove ash, and shield it from wind. The fire represents personal energy. Too little attention, and it dies; too much force, and it scorches. By tending it intentionally, he ensures steady, usable energy. Similarly, your daily routines, diet, sleep, and mental focus act as fuel and shield for your inner fire.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Anchoring energy also requires <strong>rituals</strong>. Small, repeated practices — morning stretches, brief meditation, mindful meals, walking outdoors — serve as anchors. They ground your energy, making your upstream habits resilient, even when external conditions fluctuate.</p>

  <div class="reflection">
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Notice where your energy leaks. Are there moments of distraction or irritation that sap vitality? Are there relationships or tasks that drain more than they give? Awareness alone is not enough; anchoring energy transforms knowledge into sustainable action.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="exercise">
    <h3>Extended Exercise: Energy Mapping</h3>
    <p>Draw three concentric circles on a page. The innermost circle is your core energy — sleep, diet, meditation, exercise. The middle circle is your energy interactions — relationships, work, learning. The outer circle is external demands — social media, errands, noise. Map each item to a circle and assess whether it drains or boosts energy. Prioritize the inner and middle circle activities to flow upstream.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="reflection">
    <h3>Practical Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Start your day with a 15-minute movement or meditation routine.</li>
      <li>Batch notifications to reduce constant distractions.</li>
      <li>Schedule “energy checks” mid-day to assess focus and mood.</li>
      <li>Engage in at least one activity that replenishes energy daily (walk, music, journaling).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="reflection">
    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Which daily activities drain your energy most?</li>
      <li>How can you reinforce energy-boosting practices this week?</li>
      <li>Where do you notice mental or emotional leaks in your day?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="microaction">
    <h3>Micro-Action Plan</h3>
    <p>Choose one energy anchor to integrate tomorrow morning — a stretch routine, meditation, or mindful breakfast. Track how it impacts your focus and mood. Gradually layer two more anchors over the week. Anchored energy compounds, enabling upstream habits to flow naturally and sustainably.</p>
